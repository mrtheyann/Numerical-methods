## Lab 03

1) Solve equation corresponding to your student ID by Newton's method with absolute error ε < 0.0001

`x lg x - 1,2 = 0`
 
2) Solve the equation corresponding to your student ID by simple iteration with absolute error ε < 0.0001

`5x - 8 ln x = 8`

3) Solve the equation to within ε < 0.0001

`2x ** 3 + 9 x ** 2 - 4 = 0`

4) Solve the problems 1-3 using Numpy methods
