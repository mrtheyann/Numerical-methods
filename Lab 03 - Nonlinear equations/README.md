## Lab 03

#### 1) Solve equation corresponding to your student ID by Newton's method with absolute error ε < 0.0001

`x lg x - 1,2 = 0`

* Determine the roots graphically
 
* Perform calculations and arrange them in a table
 
#### 2) Solve the equation corresponding to your student ID by simple iteration with absolute error ε < 0.0001

`5x - 8 ln x = 8`

* Determine the roots graphically
 
* Perform calculations and arrange them in a table

#### 3) Solve the equation to within ε < 0.0001

`2x ** 3 + 9 x ** 2 - 4 = 0`

* Determine the roots graphically
 
* Use bisection method, method of proportional parts, mixed method of both tangents and chords

#### 4) Solve the problems 1-3 using Numpy methods

* Repeat your solutions 1-3 using Numpy build-ins

* Determine the roots graphically

* Make sure your code structure is valid and separated to cells
